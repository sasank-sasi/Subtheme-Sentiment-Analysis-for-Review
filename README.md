## Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on customer reviews by identifying subthemes within the reviews and determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) for each subtheme. The process involves loading and preprocessing the dataset, extracting subthemes, analyzing sentiments, and evaluating the model's performance.


## Steps

### Load and Preprocess the Dataset
- Loading the Data
- Cleaning Subthemes
- Splitting Review and Subthemes
- Dropping the Original Column

### Preprocess the Review Text
- Cleaning the Text
- Lowercasing
- Tokenizing
- Removing Stopwords
- Lemmatizing

### Extract Subthemes and Sentiments
- Subtheme Extraction
- Sentiment Analysis

### Evaluate the Results
- Parsing Subthemes
- Comparison and Evaluation

## Potential Improvements and Advanced Approaches

### Enhanced Subtheme Extraction
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- Custom NER (Named Entity Recognition) Models

### Advanced Sentiment Analysis
- Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Models
- Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)

### Data Augmentation
- Synthetic Data Generation
- Back Translation

### Evaluation and Feedback Loop
- Cross-Validation
- Human-in-the-Loop

### Deployment and Monitoring
- Real-Time Sentiment Analysis
- Model Monitoring and Retraining

## Conclusion
This project outlines a systematic approach to subtheme sentiment analysis in customer reviews, with potential improvements using advanced NLP techniques and models. By leveraging enhanced subtheme extraction, advanced sentiment analysis, data augmentation, robust evaluation, and continuous monitoring, the accuracy and effectiveness of the analysis can be significantly improved.
